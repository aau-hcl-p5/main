\section{Discussion and perspectivation}
In order to conclude upon the success of the project, the MoSCoW analysis and the test cases formulated in Subsection~\ref{subsec:requirements} will be used.

\subsection{MoSCoW conclusion}
In the MoSCoW analysis, a set of prioritized requirements were formulated.
In order for the project to be deemed successful, all of the \textit{must have} requirements must be fulfilled and most of the \textit{should have} requirements as well.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
% Viable, but toys are not optimal for such a project


\subsection{Test cases}



\subsection{Machine intelligence}
% MI discussion
%% MI guys go here
%% Training to detect birds / drones rather than a red color would require MI and more powerful hardware 
%% online learning for movement
%calibration was made due to heavy weight of head, which proved irrelevant later on - but will be relevant again if a projectile is added, as that will add weight.

\subsection{Real-time requirements}
% RTS discussion
%% Platform much more powerful than needed
%% CPU utilization
%% Choice of scheduling algorithm, EDF would be better but cannot be implemented with OSEK yet

% Development practices which will be elaborated upon.
