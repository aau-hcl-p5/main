\section{Conclusion}
In the last few sections, different aspects of the system were considered.

\paragraph{Architecture}
A specific architecture was decided upon.
A graph of the different components was created, and based on this, the development of the solution can take shape concurrently.


\paragraph{Components}
It was reasoned that both an NXT and a Raspberry Pi should be used.
The NXT will be utilized for the movement and predictions, whereas the Raspberry Pi is used for detecting the location of the target. 


Motors and hardware as analysed, tested and finally chosen. 
These decisions will help shape the physical aspects of the solution.


\paragraph{Algorithms}
%TODO write the specific algorithm that we decide upon using. also make sure  this is actually up to date [ask thomas]
GOTURN was chosen as the default machine-learned algorithm.
However, using a learned algorithm, can be rather ineffective in these cases, so each specific algorithm will have different pros and cons.
Therefore, the reasoned solution was to implement multiple algorithms in a modular fashion, so they can be used interchanged.


The sum of these considerations should be a vision of a specific solution, which is creatable. 
These considerations should be seen as the reasoning for the implementation expressed in the following chapter.
