\section{Conclusion}
In the last few sections, different aspects of the system were considered.
%TODO Jeg forstår ikke lige helt resten her, måske elaborate on it.
%TODO Jeg antager at det er for lige at summere de forskellige ting der er gennemgået i kapitlet, men det er bare lidt wack lige nu. Jeg kan godt skrive det om, bare lige sig til.
A specific architecture was decided upon - using a mixture of an NXT and a Raspberry Pi, and what each of these will be used for.
Different algorithms was considered, both algorithms for the solution itself as well as machine learning algorithms.
An solution was deemed relevant, where all algorithms was useable, in a modular way, however a specific algorithm was chosen as the primary, based on the reasoning presented in this chapter.
% TODO write the specific algorithm
Motors and hardware was analysed and chosen, which helped shape the hardware architecture.


This chapter should envision a specific solution, which is creatable.
