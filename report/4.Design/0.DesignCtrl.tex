\chapter{Design}
The theory chapter uncovered and elaborated on different algorithms and technologies.
This chapter will explain which algorithms and what technology will be applied in the project, as well as explain the thought process behind the different design choices.
This is done by testing the different algorithms and technologies, where applicable.
The results of these tests will be used to determine an optimal solution for the project.
