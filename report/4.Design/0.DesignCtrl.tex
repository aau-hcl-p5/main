\chapter{Design}
Based on the theory uncovered a set of different algorithms and technologies.
Now it is needed to reason for why which algorithm and technology should be used.
This is going to be done by testing each thing, and based on this find the optimal solution.
The optimal solution will be presented in the end of this chapter, combined with an in depth look at the architecture
