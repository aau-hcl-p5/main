\chapter{Design}
The theory chapter uncovered and elaborated on different algorithms and technologies.
This chapter will reason for why which algorithm and technology should be used.
This is going to be done by testing the different algorithms and technologies.
The results of these tests will be used to determine an optimal solution for the project.
This solution will be presented in the end of this chapter, combined with an in depth look at the architecture
