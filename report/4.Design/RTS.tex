\section{Real-time system}\label{Design:RTS} 
In order for the project to qualify as a real-time system it must be able to respond correctly in a timely manner.
In the following section, the design decisions made for the project in regards to ensuring this will be elaborated upon. 

\subsection{Scheduling}\label{Design:Scheduling}
When choosing a scheduling method for the system, multiple methods were considered. 
Both fixed priority scheduling and cyclic executive were considered for the system as both of them would be good at handling the tasks of the system with their deadlines.

Cyclic executive was chosen due the the fast execution time of the tasks, and that preemption and context switching would exceed the time for simply completing the previous task. 
It was reasoned that since all tasks should run regularly, and execute fast enough to run within the major cycle the cyclic execution method should be perfect. 

The cyclic executive method is a common way to implement hard real-time systems due to its simplicity, deterministic behavior and relative ease of implementation\cite{CyclicExecutionKimLarsen}.
