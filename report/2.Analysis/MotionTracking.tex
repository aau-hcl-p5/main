\section{Object Tracking}
\label{sec:obj_tracking}
To track the location of a target, the device will require sensors that can transmit information about the position of the desired target.
%One could imagine a couple of different sensors that could potentially gather information about the position of the target.
As the goal is to eventually track birds, a camera with object classification, is an obvious choice, as it allows for the identification of specific objects.
%For instance, laser and sonar could both be used to gather some information about the position of a target\cite{Sensors}.
%However, since the system should be adaptable to a dynamic environment with potentially a lot of different objects in motion, one sensor was deemed the most obvious choice for this system; a camera.
%Using a camera is powerful, since images can be processed in order to determine what objects are present in the image.
%Once the location of the object is determined within the image, the direction of the target can be calculated.
With an object located, and assuming that the camera is aimed in the same direction as the laser, the direction to aim will simply be calculated using the delta $X$ and $Y$ coordinates of the target and the center of the image.

Unfortunately, the camera has a couple of disadvantages.
First, a normal camera will not be able to determine the distance to a target.
This could be solved with a distance sensor, as described in Subsection~\ref{anal:distance}.
Secondly, the camera will output redundant information, which will have to be processed, in order to only keep the relevant information.
Third, any relevant information is only deduced from the image. 

\subsection{Image processing}
To determine the location of the object in the image, the image needs to be processed.

Generally speaking there are two approaches to this problem.
\subsubsection{Hand-coded features}
Writing an object recognition algorithm by hand, is a tedious task if the object to detect, is complex.
However, if the object has distinct features, it becomes simpler.
Imagine that an algorithm were to detect a red ball. 
Given the two features \textit{round} and \text{red}, it would be a manageable task to implement an algorithm that would detect a red ball.

Although the hand-coded algorithms may be usable given a few distinct features, it will quickly fall short when given the task to detect a face or a bird.

\subsubsection{Machine learning}\label{sec:obj_tracking:sub:ML}
Rather than trying to describe a complex object using an algorithm, an oft-used alternative is to let the computer figure out the features of the object itself.
This is what is referred to as machine learning.

Machine learning is a common term used when a computer teaches itself to solve a given task\cite{ArtificialIntelligencealanpoole}.
There are a wide variety of tasks that are very complicated to solve using algorithms, but comparatively easier to solve by letting the computer learn how to solve them. 
There are many ways to apply machine learning to a problem, such as object localization, object detection, object classification, which were already discussed in \autoref{sec:anal:objdet}, as well as speech recognition or learning the best tactics of games like chess.

Machine learning is highly relevant for this system, as it can be used both to locate objects, but also when tracking and prediction where the object is and will be.
