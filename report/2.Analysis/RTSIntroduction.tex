\section{Managing systems in Real Time}
\label{sec:rts-intro}
When using sensors and motors in a real world application, it is relevant to consider how time critical the actions are.
The introduction listed examples of a real world problems, where this applies.
In the case of the shooting birds in airports to prevent accidents, the bird must be removed, before it hits a plane.
This is also the case in military defense systems, where the incoming missile must be shot down before it reaches its target. 
Both of examples are time critical, as the given device has to continuously follow a moving target, and shoot the target before it hits its target.
%the target will not move slower because of latency of the system.

Even in the simple case of hitting a ball, a rather mundane target in relation to the examples, it is important to build an efficient system, especially when using a small architecture, such as the NXT.
This is done using the principles of real-time systems.
%, and looking at specific problems relating to the issue of this report.

\subsection{Deadlines}
As the device has to hit a target, it is important to know exactly how long it takes for the device to react, with a reasonable degree of certainty such that the laser is going to lead the target, rather than follow it. 
The deadline is the time-frame of a given prediction, as given by the trajectory prediction module, as the data will become obsolete within an arbitrary time frame.
This time frame can either be dynamic, based on the predictability of a given target, or a constant specified at the time of development.

\subsection{Schedulability}
\todo{Fix det her, fatter ikke hvad der står}
Being able to schedule the relevant events; processing the image, predicting the trajectory, and moving the motors, before the data is irrelevant, or the target is out of sight are all important parts of the system.
\todo{HER til}
To achieve this, the time frame and order of these actions, need to be considered. 
\\\\
\subsection{Takeaways}
Scheduling tasks and meeting their deadlines is required, as it is impossible to interact with a moving targets and a changing world, without considering them.
Therefore, the principles of real-time systems are relevant to the problems of this project and will be explored in \autoref{Theory:RTS}.
