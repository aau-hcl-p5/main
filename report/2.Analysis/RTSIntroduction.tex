\section{Managing systems in Real Time} 
The introduction listed multiple examples of a real world problems.
One of the examples were military defence systems, where the device would have to shoot down missiles.
In this case it is rather important that the missile is shot down before it reaches its target.
The other example, was shooting birds in airports.
Both of these examples are time critical in the sense that the given device has to continuously follow a moving target, and the target will not move slower because of latency of the system.

Even in the case of hitting a ball, a rather mundane target relatively, it is important to build an efficient system, especially when using a small architecture, such as the NXT.
This is done by using the principles of real-time systems, and looking at specific problems relating to the issue of this report.

\subsection{Deadlines}
As the device has to predict where to aim the laser, it is important to know exactly how long it takes for the device to react, within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, so the laser is going to lead the target, rather than follow it. 
The deadline, in this case is the time-frame of a given prediction, as given by the trajectory prediction module, as the data will become obsolete within an arbitrary time-frame.
This time-frame can either be dynamic, based on the predictability of a given target, or a constant specified at the time of development.

\subsection{Schedulability}
It is quite important to be able to schedule the relevant events; processing the image, predicting the trajectory, and moving the motors, before the data is irrelevant, or the target is out of sight.
To do this, certain analytical considerations need to be made, regarding the time-frame of these actions. 
It is also relevant regarding the order in which to do the different tasks, and estimate what has the highest relevance.

\subsection{Takeaway}
Looking into how to optimize the different processes is important.
Without considering the order in which to do tasks, and the expected time-frame of a task, it is impossible to interact with a moving targets and a changing world. 
Therefore, the principles of real-time systems, are quite relevant to the problems of this project.
