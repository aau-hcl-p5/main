\section{Managing systems in Real Time} 
On of the examples that this project was build upon, was defense systems on boats, where the device has to shoot down missiles.
In this case it is rather important that the missile is shot down before it reaches its target.
The other example, was shooting birds in airports.
Both of these examples are time critical in the sense that the given device has to continuously follow a moving target, and the target obviously will not move slower because of latency in the CPU.

So even in the case of hitting a ball, a rather mundane target relatively, it is important to build an efficient system, especially when using a small architecture, such as the NXT.
This is done by using real time system principles.
A couple of different principles and specific problems, should be considered regarding this issue.

\paragraph{Deadlines}
As the device has to predict where to aim the laser, it is important to know exactly how long it takes for the device to react, within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, so the laser is going to lead the target, rather than follow it. 
The deadline, in this case, is the target being out of range, and the time frame is a function based on the speed and acceleration of the target. 
Deadlines can also be more critical in as data might lose relevance and become obsolete. 
Depending on how the object moves, and how predictable the target is, it is important to make the react-time as quick as possible, as a larger time frame might make the predicted location less certain.

\paragraph{Schedulability}
It is quite important to be able to schedule the relevant events; processing the image, predicting the trajectory, and moving the motors, before the target is out of sight.
To do this certain analytic decisions need to be made, regarding the time frame of these actions. 
It is also quite relevant regarding the order in which to do the different tasks, and estimate what has the highest relevance.

\paragraph{Takeaway}
Looking into how to optimize the different processes is important.
Without considering the order in which to do tasks, and the expected time frame of a task, it is impossible to interact with a moving targets and a changing world. 
Therefore, the principles of Real Time Systems, are quite relevant to the problems of this project.
