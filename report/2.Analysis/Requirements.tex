\section{Requirements}
In order to be able to conclude upon the success of the project, a fixed set of requirements must be formulated.
These requirements will serve as a guideline in the conclusion of the report and as markers throughout the project. 
To formally specify the requirements, the MoSCoW analysis model will be utilized. 
The MoSCoW model specifies which requirements \textbf{M}ust, \textbf{S}hould, \textbf{C}ould, and \textbf{W}on't be fulfilled to deem the project successful.

\textbf{Must have}
\begin{itemize}
\item ability to recognize a moving target in front of the device using an attached camera
\item ability to hit a target moving with a constant speed along a horizontal axis
\item move fast enough to keep the laser on the moving target in real time
\item ability to move the laser at least 60 degrees in both horizontal and vertical directions from the origin.
\item ability to predict the next location of the object moving along a linear pattern
\item enough structural stability to be able to move without breaking
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Should have}
\begin{itemize}
\item ability to hit a larger moving target in the air at a low speed, such as a balloon \item ability to hit a small moving target in the air, such as red ball
\item ability to predict the next location of the object moving along a non-linear path
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Could have}
\begin{itemize}
\item ability to calculate the distance to the target object
\item use ballistic projectile to hit the target
\item calculate the angle and power necessary to hit the target with a projectile
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Won't have at this time}
\begin{itemize}
\item ability to actually take down objectives
\item ability to differentiate between the type of object that is being observed
\end{itemize}

By fulfilling the requirements specified in the must have section, the device will be able to track a target with a rather predictable movement pattern and use the attached laser to indicate the tracking. 
With the should have requirements the functionality of the device is extended to track more advanced movement patterns, which in a real life scenario could be drones or birds in the air while still using the laser to indicate the tracking.
If the could have requirements are fulfilled the device will be able to calculate the distance to the observed target, calculate angle and power required to hit the target and fire a ballistic projectile at it.
Finally, the won't have requirements are deemed outside the scope of the current project and focus on the future application of the device, which would require more efficient projectiles in order to take down the observed target and being able to differentiate between whether the object is a threat or not.
