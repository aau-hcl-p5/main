\section{Object detection, localization and tracking}\label{sec:anal:objdet}
Before examining the different ways to look for objects using computer vision, it is important to ensure a correct understanding of the terminology used when working with objects in images.
Object recognition is the discipline of computers working with objects in images, and has multiple sub-disciplines\cite{objecttrackdetect}.


\begin{description}
	\item[Object recognition:] Finding objects in an image, regardless of it being detection, localization, tracking or classification. 
    \item[Object classification:] Identifying objects in an image.
    \item[Object localization:] Finding the location of a single object in an image{.} Here it is irrelevant whether it is a bounding box for the object, an actual outline, or just an average location. 
    \item[Object detection:] Finding the location of multiple objects in an image{.} Usually the location of each individual object will be outlined with a bounding box, to ensure clarity as to which pixels represent each object.
    \item[Object tracking:] Doing object localization or detection over time, and optionally storing the previous locations.
