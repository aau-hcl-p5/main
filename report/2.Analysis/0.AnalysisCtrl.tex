\chapter{Analysis}
This chapter will delve into different technologies regarding the creation of an autonomous turret. 
Each section will investigate an important area of either software or hardware, and each of these section will conclude some takeaways and decisions that can be made because of the presented information.
The goal of this process, will be to specify a concrete problem that we can solve, as well as some requirements we can utilize to verify whether the solution we produce is successful.
