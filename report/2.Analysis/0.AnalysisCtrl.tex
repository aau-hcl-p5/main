\chapter{Analysis}
This chapter will analyze the different technologies used to develop an autonomous turret. 
Each section will investigate an important area of either software or hardware, and each of these sections will conclude some takeaways and decisions, based on the presented information.
The goal of this process, will be to specify a concrete problem that can be solved, but also to set some specific requirements that can verify whether the final solution is successful.
