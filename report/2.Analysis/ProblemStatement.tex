\section{Problem statement}
After a thorough analysis, based on the intitial problem statement \ref{key:initialProblem}, a concrete problem statement can be formulated:
\begin{center}
	\textit{Different zones, such as airports, military bases or just private properties, do not allow flying objects across their territories.}
	\textit{The goal of this project, will be to develop a solution that can target a moving object.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can the communication between the different devices be designed, so that it (communication) is not delayed? 
	\item How can accurate predictions be made, while also handling changes in trajectory?
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
