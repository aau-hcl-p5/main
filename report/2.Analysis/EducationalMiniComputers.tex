% This section is meant to introduce single-board computers that are often used for introducing programmers to beginners.
% The section itself might not be used a whole lot during the design and implementation, as these are not the arduino platform.
% Still, it is good to give examples of implementations.
\section{Embedded platform}
In the following section will examine the embedded platforms, that will be used in the project.
For the 5th semester of the Software education, a Lego Mindstorms kit is supplied to each project group.
Therefore the analysis will primarily be based around the Lego Mindstorms platform, with a few additional platforms also considered.

To determine the best platform, the requirements for the project will need to be considered.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item At the very least, the platform must be able to perform a targeting calculation, based on a machine learning model.
	\item Be able to interface with motors, most likely Lego.
	\item Potentially be able to train a machine learning model, which is used for the prediction on which the targeting is based.
\end{enumerate}

As image recognition is an expensive computation, the current idea is to offload this to an external server or computer, which will compute the current object position and send that to the embedded device.

\subsection{Lego Mindstorms}
Lego Mindstorms is a programmable computer kit, made by Lego.
The platform is based around a central control computer, called the Intelligent Brick.
It also includes a variety of sensors, motors and connection cables.
Each generation further improves on the concept, adding more computational power and better sensors.

The choices for the 5th semester are the second generation, the Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 kit and the third generation, the Lego Mindstorms EV3 kit.

\subsection{Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0}
The Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 (NXT), is a micro computer kit, based around the NXT Intelligent Brick.
The NXT Intelligent Brick is a micro computer based on the 32-bit ARM7 microprocessor, with 256 kbytes of flash memory and 64 kbytes of RAM\cite{nxt2userguide}.
It includes a variety of sensors, such as touch, sound, light and ultrasonic (vision) sensors.
On top of this it also includes servo motors and lamps.

The default way to program the NXT is a graphical drag and drop interface, but a variety of compilers, for a variety of languages exist.











\section{Educational single-board computers}
While HCL is developed for the Arduino, other educational computer platforms are analyzed, to gain further inspiration.

Apart from the Arduino board, a lot of other single-board computers(SBCs) have been created with educational purposes in mind.
To figure out why these SBCs are so popular for technical learning, some of the most popular ones were analyzed.
This should help to figure out which functionality HCL should include in order to comply with the educational intend of the SBCs\cite{SBC}.
As such this section explores the Arduino Platform and its competitors.

\subsection{Arduino Platform}
The Arduino platform is an open-source, programmable mini-computer\cite{ArFAQ}.
It is designed to be used in small electronics projects, and for teaching computer science.
The Arduino eco-system is comprised of many different boards, that all share the same language, and easy programmability.

The different Arduino models typically consists of a microprocessor, a small amount of RAM, a small amount of persistent memory and some easily programmable I/O ports, known as GPIO pins\footnote{General Purpose Input Output}.
To program these GPIO pins, the Arduino programming language, a subset of \texttt{C++}, is used.
The Arduino programming language is most often written in the Arduino IDE, which also allows for uploading the compiled code to the Arduino boards.
The Arduino programming language is further elaborated in section (\ref{arduinoC}).

The Arduino Uno is the model of choice for this project.
According to the Arduino website, the Uno is the best board to get started with electronics and coding, and this is evident as it is often used in education\footnote{4 members of the group used the Arduino Uno in their electronics classes.}\cite{ArduinoUno}.

The Arduino Uno has 14 programmable GPIO pins, 32 KB of flash memory (31.5 KB available) for uploading code, and 2 KB of RAM.
The Arduino Uno has an ATmega328P microcontroller, and operates at 5 volt.
Programs are uploaded with a USB B cable.

\subsection{Raspberry Pi}
The Raspberry Pi is one of the most widely known SBCs. 
It is a complete ARM-based computer, and may run anything ARM based, including both Linux and Windows based ARM operating systems. 
This makes it a common entry point into the GNU/Linux operating system stack, which is generally considered to be highly educational in regards to how computers work.
The default Raspberry Pi distribution ships with both Scratch and Python, allowing the user to quickly get started with programming\cite{RaspberryPi}.

On top of this, one of the major selling points of the Raspberry Pi is the GPIO\footnote{general purpose input output} pins. 
These allow the user to attach all kinds of devices to the board, including sensors, lights, cameras and breadboards. 
The Raspberry Pi allows the user to easily interact with the GPIO pins, making it an ideal device for both Internet of Things (IoT), home automation and robotics\cite{RaspberryPi}.

\subsection{Lego Mindstorm}
Lego Mindstorm is a robot kit from Lego. 
The intent is to built a robot out of Lego, with the belonging motors and sensors which can then be controlled by the "head". 
The head is a small computer, which can control and monitor all the attached motors and sensors. 
The computer can be programmed from either a tablet or a computer using a drag and drop programming environment similar to that of Scratch (\ref{sec:Scratch})\cite{LegoMindstorms}.

\subsection{Takeaway}
Apart from being cheap, the big motivation behind these SBCs seem to be the extensibility through attachments. 
This allows the users to create something very concrete. 
For instance, it may be more rewarding for the user to get an actual lamp to blink or a car to drive, rather than just outputting something to the console. 
The attachments will allow the user to build something robotic, which is a common desire or goal for both new and experienced developers\cite{EducationalRobotics}.

Since the Arduino platform also has the ability to connect various devices through its GPIO pins, it would be ideal to incorporate some easy to use GPIO handling into HCL.
