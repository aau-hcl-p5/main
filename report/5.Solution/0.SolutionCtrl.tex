\chapter{Solution}

Based on the considerations the design chapter, regarding both the architecture and technological choices, development on the system envisioned in the previous chapter, can now begin.
This solution should help us conclude upon the problem statement, and whether the system actually does this, will be explored in Chapter \ref{sec:conclusion}, Conclusion.
The solution chapter, will delve into the solution and implementation of the system.
The specific parts of the solution have been hand picked, based on relevance to the courses, and based on the complexity of the aspects of the solution.
