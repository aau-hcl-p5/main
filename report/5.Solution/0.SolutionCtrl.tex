\chapter{Solution}

Based on the decisions described in the design chapter, regarding both the architecture and technological choices, development on the system envisioned in the previous chapter, can now begin.
This solution should help with reaching a conclusion to the problem statement, and whether the system actually does this, will be explored in \autoref{sec:conclusion}, Conclusion.

The solution chapter will elaborate on the specifics of the implementation of the solution.
The following does not describe the full implementation, but rather a selection of the most interesting aspects of the implementation.
