\subsubsection{Thresh Moment Algorithm}\label{solution:thresh_moment}
A stripped down version of the Thresh Moment algorithm can be seen in the following \autoref{lst:threshmoment}, with inline comments.

A general detailed explanation of thresh moment was described in \autoref{des:thresh}.

The algorithm gets an image as an array, and converts it to HSV.
Based on the threshold for the red color, the areas in the image within the red color range are found. 
Areas, or contours, that are too small, when compared to the other contours, are filtered out.
If there are still contours, the largest contour is selected, and the center of the selected contour, is returned as the location.
