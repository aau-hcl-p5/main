\section{Structure of Codebase}
The code for the solution is split into two parts.
One part is dedicated to locating the object, while the other part handles the movement of the robot.
%RASPBERRY MENTION, vi nævner tit og ofte Raspberry, men er det faktisk der vi ender med at køre det fra.
The location module is written in python 3{.}7 and is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi.

The movement processing runs on an NXT, running nxtOSEK, and is written in C, version C90 with GNU-extensions.

% \subsection{Movement}
% The codebase of the NXT is separated into different files with distinct responsibilities, resulting in modularity, much like described above.

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item \texttt{tasks}
% 	\item \texttt{usb}
% 	\item \texttt{display}
% 	\item \texttt{movement}
% 	\item \texttt{calibration}
% \end{itemize}

% The \texttt{tasks.c} file is the entry point of the project, which creates all the tasks that should be run on the system.
