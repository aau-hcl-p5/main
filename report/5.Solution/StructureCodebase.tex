\section{Structure of Codebase}
The code for the solution is split into two parts.
One part is dedicated to locating the object, while the other part handles the movement of the robot.
%RASPBERRY MENTION
The location module is written in python 3{.}7 and is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi.
\todo{figure out whether the python part also does the calibration or not}

The movement processing runs on an NXT, running nxtOSEK, and is written in C, version C90 with GNU-extensions.

% \subsection{Movement}
% The codebase of the NXT is separated into different files with distinct responsibilities, resulting in modularity, much like described above.

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item \texttt{tasks}
% 	\item \texttt{usb}
% 	\item \texttt{display}
% 	\item \texttt{movement}
% 	\item \texttt{calibration}
% \end{itemize}

% The \texttt{tasks.c} file is the entry point of the project, which creates all the tasks that should be run on the system.
