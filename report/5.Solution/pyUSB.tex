\subsection{Python USB implementation}\label{sol:subsec:pythonusb}
%Denne er mÃ¥ske alt for detaljeret
In \autoref{sec:usbdes} the overall design of the USB communication was described.
The following subsection will describe how the USB communication is implemented in the Python part of the the solution.
The NXT specific USB implementation will be described in \autoref{sec:nxtusbimp}.

The USB device inherits from the OutputDevice base class.
The implementation uses the PyUSB library, as described in \autoref{sec:usbdes}\cite{PyUSB}.

\autoref{lst:PythonUSBInit} shows the initialization of the NxtUsb module, which handles the USB communication from Python to the NXT.
\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:PythonUSBInit},caption={The initialization of PyUSB{.} Comments removed}]
def __enter__(self):
    self.device = usb.core.find(idVendor=ID_VENDOR_LEGO, idProduct=ID_PRODUCT_NXT)

    if self.device is None:
        raise DeviceNotFound('Device not found')

    self.device.set_configuration()

    self.out_endpoint, self.in_endpoint = self.device[0][(0, 0)]
    self.out_endpoint.write(b'\x01\xFF') 
    self.device.read(self.in_endpoint.bEndpointAddress, 8) 
    self.initialized = True
    return self
\end{lstlisting}

The code itself is relatively self-explanatory, and only the most interesting parts will be elaborated upon.
Line 9 sets the endpoint for the outgoing communication.
Incoming communication uses a secondary endpoint, which is found at the time of reading data.

At this point in the program, the NXT is waiting for a specific code, which is sent in line 10.

When the NXT receives the code, it returns \texttt{{.}ecrobot}.
Should that be the case, it sets its initialized field to \texttt{True} and returns.

With the device initialized, communication can now happen.
The communication itself is relatively simple, with the read method simply reading directly from the byte stream, as shown in \autoref{lst:PythonUSBread}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,label={lst:PythonUSBread},caption={Reading from the USB port connected to the NXT}]
def read(self) -> bytes:
    return self.device.read(self.in_endpoint.bEndpointAddress, 8)
\end{lstlisting}

When writing to the device, there are two options:
The first, \texttt{write\_location}, writes a location to the USB, while the second \texttt{write\_status}, writes a status.
Both are shown in \autoref{lst:PythonUSBwrite}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,label={lst:PythonUSBwrite},caption={Writing from the USB port connected to the NXT}]
def write_location(self, data: Tuple[Vector, bool]) -> None:

    loc, on_target = data
    self.out_endpoint.write(bytes([
	    Status.ON_TARGET.value if on_target else Status.TARGET_FOUND.value,
        0,
        int(loc.x) & 0xFF,
        int(loc.y) & 0xFF
    ]))

def write_status(self, status: Status):
    value = status.value
    if type(value) is tuple:
        value = value[0]
    self.out_endpoint.write(bytes([
        int(value) & 0xFF,
        0
    ]))
\end{lstlisting}
Both methods send byte wise data.
