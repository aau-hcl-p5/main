\section{Predicting the location of a moving object}
In order to predict the location of a moving object a keen observation to be made, is whether the object is flying i.e{.} if the object is following a ballistic trajectory or whether the object is driving i.e{.} following a linear trajectory. 
In the following section we will elaborate on these distinctions in order to gain a deeper understanding on the subject and to be able to complete our objectives. 
\subsection{Linear trajectory}
Given that the target follows a linear trajectory a simple method to calculate the new location of the target can be applied.  
In order to predict the targets location an understanding of basic physics of kinematics is required. 
That is given an object is traveling with constant speed, the distance traveled by the object can be described as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Distance}
s = v \cdot t
\end{equation}
where $ s $ is the distance traveled, $ v $ is the velocity and $ t $ is the time passed.
Hence an object traveled $ 1 m/s $ for $ 1 s $ will have traveled 1 meter. 
Based in Equation~\ref{eqn:Distance} the $ v $ can be isolated resulting in:
\begin{eauation}\label{eqn:Speed}
v = 
\cfrac{
s
}{
t
}
\end{equation}
By applying Equation~\ref{eqn:Speed} the speed of the target can be established. 
In order to calculate the future position of the target, the targets previous location is needed, this will be solved using image recognition.

%\subsection{Ballistic trajectory}
%In order to not just track a flying object in front of the device, it is nessesary to gain a basic understanding of ballistic trajectories in order to predict where the object will be after a given period of time.
