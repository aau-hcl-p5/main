\section{Using a camera for estimating direction}
As mentioned in the requirements (Subsection~\ref{subsec:requirements}), a camera will be used to identify the presence of a moving target.
In this section, the theory of how a camera processes a three dimensional world into a two dimensional video and how this is applicable to the project will be elaborated upon.

\subsection{The perspective of a camera}
When a camera captures a picture, it makes use of perspective projection.
This means that the camera is able to transform a world consisting of three dimensional objects into a flat picture, which can be seen on for example a computer screen.

As seen on Figure~\ref{fig:perspective} the two objects that are captured in the view frustum are represented in the viewport in a two-dimensional format.
For this project, using this format is advantageous since the primary focus lies in hitting a moving object with a laser.
The concrete implementation, tailored to our solution, will be explored and elaborated on in the solution chapter.


\subsection{Hitting a target with a laser}
The major benefit of working with a laser is that it is almost not affected by gravity, meaning that finding the intersection between the target and the laser is easy with the image generated by the camera.
Rather than having to calculate the direction of the target in a three dimensional space, meaning that the distance has to be taken into account, it is simply possible to compare two images captured by the camera.

As seen on Figure~\ref{fig:estimate} two subsequent frames, a and b, are used for used for finding a moving object with the assumption that the rest of the frame is static. 
When comparing the two frames, as seen on c, it is easily seen that everything but the red ball is static.
With this information, it is possible to estimate the next position of the ball, indicated by the blue ball in d, using the assumption that the ball keeps moving in the same direction with the same speed.
However, this will seldom be the case, due to the acceleration of the tracked object.
Since this variable will likely be based upon experience, a solution to estimate the next position of the ball is to use a neural network for object recognition.

Since the first edition of the system will be using a laser as its shooting mechanism, the only information needed to hit the object is the relative distance between two frames in the image stream provided by the camera. 
Then knowing the relative distance between to frames it should be fairly simple to move the robot accordingly.
