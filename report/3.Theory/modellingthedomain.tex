\section{Modelling the domain}\label{Theory:MIModelling}
When designing a MI system, it is important to consider the agent, the input it receives, and how it acts according to the inputs to affect the environment it acts in.

An agent, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:agentenvironment}, is an abstraction on an entity that acts in an environment based on its perception of said environment~\cite{ArtificialIntelligencealanpoole}.
It might be intelligent in the context of acting purposefully, by trying to obtain it's preferences and goals by performing actions, or it might act un-purposefully, where actions has no relation to goals.
These two types are called \textit{Purposeful Agents} and \textit{Nature}.

Examples of agents could be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Software agents}, which solely operate on a computational environment, i{.}e{.} it modifies a software environment
	\item \textbf{Robotic agents}, which perceives the environment through sensors and performs actions on the environment through motors and other actuators.
	\item \textbf{Human agents}, which is quite simply a human. 
\end{itemize}

An agent can choose an action based on the \textit{stimuli} from its \textit{environment}.
This means that even though an agent is purposeful, it might accidentally act against its goal.
This is caused by the fact that it cannot objectively know the effect of each action, but only try to reason about the effects.


The actions are reasoned on based on a subset of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Abilities}, which are a definition of the capabilities of the agent, i{.}e{.} what actions the agent can perform.
    \item \textbf{Goals}, which are the preferences of the agent, meaning what goal it will attempt to fulfil.
    \item \textbf{Any prior knowledge}, which is knowledge about the agent itself and the environment it acts in.
    \item \textbf{Stimuli}, from sensors or other observations from the environment.
    \item \textbf{Past experience}, which is a summation of previous actions, data, and stimuli from the environment.
\end{itemize}

The agent acts on the environment based on these inputs.
An environment is understood in the context of an agent, and can be categorized as either a physical or a computational environment.
An environment combined with an agent is called a world, and a world might contain multiple agents.
In a multi agent world, it can be beneficial for an agent to consider the inputs of other agents, which might be a complex task if the other agents act purposefully.

When designing the system, it is important to consider the world, so that the agent can act purposefully and reach its goals.
When trying to reach the goals of the agent, different types of solutions can be found.
The \textit{optimal solution} is the best solution according to some measurement of quality.
This solution is ideal, but it might not be required, and in some cases is a purely hypothetical solution, that might not be feasible in reality.
In most cases the \textit{satisfactory solution} might be non-optimal, according to the actual requirements of the system, as a solution might be close enough for the goal of the agent.
