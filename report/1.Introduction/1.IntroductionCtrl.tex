\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Initial analysis}
Tracking airborne objects can be quite difficult, as hitting an airborne target requires tracking the object, along with its velocity and direction, as well as the calculation or prediction of its future trajectory.
The trajectory can be impacted by a number of different factors, including gravity, wind, initial force, or any artificial acceleration.
Furthermore, if the object is intelligent it might change its path, resulting in the predictions no longer being relevant.
Tracking of airborne objects has different applications.
\subsection{Airports}
\textit{Birdstrikes} is the event of a bird colliding with aircrafts\cite{WildlifeStrikeReport}.
An estimated thirteen thousand happen each year, most often during landing or takeoff\cite{CostOfBirdstrikes}.
Although 65\% of the cases result in insignificant damage, the total yearly cost is estimated at 1.2 billion dollars worldwide\cite{CostOfBirdstrikes}.


Airports utilize different methods of bird control, including, trapping, poison, lights and shooting the birds\cite{BirdControlAtAirports}.
Shooting the birds has been observed as being effective in combination with using other methods.
This both eliminates individual birds, but also scares away other birds, which prevents potential bird strikes.
However, the downside are the expenses in both salaries and effort.

\subsection{Military}
In a military setting, hitting a moving airborne target is relevant in a defensive context, such as destroying incoming projectiles or shooting down hostile planes.
Contrary to the airport case, the problem can arise at a variety of locations, both on vehicles, boats, planes and tanks, but also on stationary military installations.
The American military developed the Phalanx CIWS, a close-in weapon system, which is a radar-guided 20mm Gatling-style rotary cannon, mounted on a base that moves on two axes.
These are mounted on ships and can shoot incoming missiles and other airborne objects deemed a threat.
Alternatives to the Phalanx exist, for example the Goalkeeper, and must rely on similar principles.
Both the Phalanx and Goalkeeper are autonomous systems.

\subsection{Initial Problem}
Tracking an airborne object has multiple different problem domains, making it an interesting domain to research.
This report will examine ways of solving the aforementioned problem on a smaller scale.

Before hitting an airborne target, it is important to estimate its trajectory, and the problem can therefore be split into two sub-problems:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Calculating the time it takes before a projectile will reach the target.
  \item Calculating where the target will be in T milliseconds.
\end{enumerate}
Combined, these two subproblems results in the practice of finding the spot where the travel time of the target meets the travel time of the projectile.

As the goal of this semester project is to apply the knowledge from the real time systems and machine intelligence courses, the problem that the project seeks to solve, should be within the domain of both, which is the case with the trajectory prediction problem.

In regards to machine intelligence, the problem of tracking an airborne target has potential for intelligent analysis by an artificial agent.
Likewise, it is a time-critical task to rotate a turret so that it aims at the target and hits the target, before the target is out of range or hits the ground.

The report will use simplified targets to remove unpredictable parameters, and to remove the possibility of harming any living creatures.

These considerations leads to the following initial problem:

The analysis will result in a more in-depth set of requirements and a concrete problem statement.
