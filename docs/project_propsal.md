#Lego NXT Tracking - A AAU project proposal


##Canon/laser/tracking
The idea is to save lives at airports by shooting down birds/drones (could also be applied at AAU campus) before they enter restricted airspace over the airport. This will be done by either shooting an lego dart to hit the target or by activating a laser pointer that hits the target. 


###Key problems:
- The idea is to create a device, that can track a moving object, and potentially fire a projectile that will hit the target.
- We predict multiple iterations. However, some major iterations could include:
	- Start with “hit” and later go with “track”
	- Track target only using one axis and follow it with a laser
	- Track target with laser on two axises, however target will remain on the same vertical level.
	- Slowly introducing more dimensions for movement of target
	- Hit target with an actual projectile.
	- Allow the target to move vertically. Eg. bounce a ball towards the device.
- Making the embedded system move fast enough to follow the target
- Calculating distance to target and predicting the movement of it
- Course basis:
	- MI: Estimating the future location of target
	- RTS: Move the laser on relevant axes in near-instant time.


##Robot vacuum cleaner.
The idea is to improve robot vacuum cleaners by using machine learning to generate a more optimal route, based on historical data regarding dust collection and the location of the household members.

###Key problems
- Dust detection
- Location tracking
- MI heatmap of dirty areas to plan an optimal route/ plan priority routes and just general routing
- Implementing multiple routes, such that it can choose the most optimal route. e.g. an economical route and an thorough route.
